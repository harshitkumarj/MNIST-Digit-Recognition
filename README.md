# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
## Goals
**Can you predict the handwritten digits using machines?**
The goal of this project is to create a model that will be able to recognize and determine the handwritten digits from its image by using the concepts of Convolution Neural Network. The major goal of the proposed system is understanding Convolutional Neural Network, and applying it to the handwritten recognition system.
